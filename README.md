# Golden Ratio Viewer

Golden ratio viewer is a program based on JavaFX with the aim of visualizing the golden ratio, as well as other ratios in an easy to understand way.
This project is made for my 2020 Computer Science Course.

## Installation

Golden Ratio viewer depends on JavaFX, and I recommend using Intellij with it to simplify things. If you used Intellij it is as simple as opening the project files in Intellij - making sure you have Intellij's built in JDK as your selected JDK.
Then you should be able to click Build > Build Project to build a copy for yourself.

You can also download a copy easily from the "Releases" tab on GitHub. 

## Features

Golden ratio viewer has many features planned, such as 

- The ability to zoom in and out on the canvas
- Inputs for distance and rotation per step
- Start & End color customization
- Being able to plot multiple graphs at the same time
- Exporting the graph
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Allowing the formula to be changed
- Allowing expressions in the input (eg 3/4)
